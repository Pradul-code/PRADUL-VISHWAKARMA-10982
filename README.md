Menu-Driven Program for Basic Number Operations (C Language)
📌 Project Overview

This project is a menu-driven C program designed to demonstrate the use of functions, loops, and switch-case statements.
The program allows the user to select different number operations from a menu and executes the selected task using separate functions.

The main objective is to build a strong understanding of:

Function creation and function calls

Control flow using switch-case

Loop-based number operations

Modular and reusable code design

Note: All logic is implemented inside functions. The main() function only displays the menu and calls functions.

🎯 Project Objectives

Create a structured menu-driven program in C

Separate logic into reusable functions

Improve clarity and maintainability of code

Strengthen understanding of loops and switch-case

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Programming Language: C

Editor: Visual Studio Code

Compiler: GCC

⚙️ Features

The program provides the following options:

Print numbers from 1 to N

Print even numbers up to N

Print odd numbers up to N

Exit program

Each operation is handled by a separate function.

🧠 Concepts Used

Functions

Function calling from main()

for / while loops

switch-case statements

User input using scanf()

📂 Program Structure

main()

Displays the menu

Takes user input

Uses switch-case to call functions

Functions:

Print numbers from 1 to N

Print even numbers up to N

Print odd numbers up to N


📝 Sample Workflow
Program displays a menu

User selects an option

User enters value of N

Corresponding function executes

Program ends after task completion

✅ Learning Outcomes
Clear understanding of function-based programming

Better control flow using menu-driven logic

Improved problem-solving skills in C

Ability to write modular and reusable code

📌 Future Enhancements (Optional)
Add looping menu until user exits

Add input validation

Extend menu with more number operations
